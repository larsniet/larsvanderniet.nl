  "description": "I have loved making things since I was little. It all started with the introduction of the Iphone. Ever since I got my first 3GS I have been fascinated by the possibilities of the internet. ;I soon started making websites and apps and I have been doing that ever since. That is also the reason I started working as a freelance web developer. This way I can work on multiple cool projects at the same time! ;I love creating things that are simple and easy to use. I am always looking for new challenges and I am always trying to learn new things.",
